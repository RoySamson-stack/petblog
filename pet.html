  <p>My pet is a dog named <strong>Abra</strong>. He is a german sheperd
    He is a working dog used for <em>security purposes</em>.
    His favorite toys include: <ul>
      <li>A teddy bear</li>
      <li>A bone</li>
      <li>His training rag</li>
    </ul>
    Abra is a good dog to people he knows and can be a little hostile
